Welcome to Xtillion's Public Github. Here we will share AI and data projects that we're passionate about and believe will leave a lasting impact on the world around us. We're excited to join the open-source community and contribute to industry-shifting initiatives.

## Our Projects
- **Xplore AI**: In this project you will find demos that were presented during Xtillion's Xplore AI Workshops. These workshops are meant to help professionals and students find their competitive advantage through AI. By discussing different real-world use cases, we can apply cutting-edge AI and software techniques to improve our everyday lives.
